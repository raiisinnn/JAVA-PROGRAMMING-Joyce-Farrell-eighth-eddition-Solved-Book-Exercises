/*
1. Suppose that you have created a program with only the following variables.
int a = 5;
int b = 6;
Suppose that you also have a method with the following header:
public static void mathMethod(int a)
Which of the following method calls are legal?
a. mathMethod(a);
b. mathMethod(b);
c. mathMethod(a + b);
d. mathMethod(a, b);
e. mathMethod(2361);
f. mathMethod(12.78);
g. mathMethod(29987L);
h. mathMethod();
i. mathMethod(x);
j. mathMethod(a / b);
*/

The methods that are illegal are: d, f, g, h, i

Explanation:

d) The method can only accept one argument, but in this case two are provided.

f) The method accepts an argument of type int, not double.

g) The method accepts an argument of type int, not long.

h) The method requires one parameter, but none are given.

i) The variable used as a parameter has not been initialized in the code.

All the other method calls are valid.
